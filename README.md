This contribution was fruit of working together through the Eth Cinco de Mayo hackathon 2024.

We participated in the Near B.O.S. track with the aim to generate an on-chain website that eases discoverability and forking through the B.O.S. while keeping the solution open to the Near and EVM communities.

You can see the prototype design, with the proposed user interface here:
